# Changelog

## [0.6.3] - 2026-10-05

### Changed

- **The release-health auth notes are now evidence-based instead of inferred from a token mention.**
  The first version warned whenever a publish workflow referenced `secrets.NPM_TOKEN` or set
  `registry-url`, which flagged `dsh-plugin-doctor` own publish workflow — a deliberate
  token-then-OIDC design that already retries via `unset NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` and republishes through
  trusted publishing whenever the token is stale. A note that cries wolf on a correct workflow is
  worse than no note. The check now reads only LIVE configuration (a match inside a comment is not
  a defect), recognises the documented retry, and downgrades that case to an explicit "fine" note.
  The warning that remains is the genuine trap — a bearer token with no retry path — and it still
  fires on `dsh-team-rooms`, which is a real finding rather than a false positive.

### Notes

- The registry probe, not the note, remains the verdict: a workflow can look wrong and publish
  correctly, or look right and fail. This pass only explains what the probe found.
## [0.6.2] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- **CC5 reported a false failure for the no-seam case, and its explanatory note could never fire.**
  The note tested the output for `no source files found under src`, but `dsh-plugin-kit`'s
  `verify-seam` phrases that situation as `src seam role "definition" marker ... not found in
  source` — so the note was dead code from the day it was written, and `doctor --repo .` failed
  its own CC5 gate. The root cause was upstream: the kit gate failed any repository with no role
  marker, which is the normal shape of a pure detector that registers nothing for others to
  consume. `dsh-plugin-kit` 0.1.16 scopes the gate to plugins that carry a seam, so the
  no-seam case is now PASS + WARN upstream and CC5 passes honestly.

### Changed

- The CC5 note now covers only the genuinely unjudgeable case — a repository with neither `src/`
  nor root-level source files — and says so explicitly, instead of offering an exemption for a
  structural exception. An incomplete seam is a failure with no exemption path.

### Result

- `node doctor.mjs --repo . --no-smoke` now exits `0` on this repository: `pass=23 skip=5`
  (previously `pass=22 skip=5 fail=1`). The remaining skips are optional-channel checks
  (certification registry, adp-list, omdsh Workshop) and are the intended end state.
- Re-verified after the fix: `node lib/verify/cli.js all .` passes on this repo, on
  `dsh-plugin-kit` itself (full trio), and on `dsh-mask` (has `src/`).
## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **A weekly release-health gate, `scripts/check-release-health.mjs` + `.github/workflows/release-health.yml`.** The 2026-10-05 family release produced five distinct failure shapes and only one of them turned a workflow red: 36 packages published green while their CHANGELOG carried `- undefined` as the release date; `dsh-local-ai@0.2.16` and `dsh-permission-rules@0.7.12` published successfully and still ended red (E409 after a tag re-push, and a GitHub-Release step with no tag ref); `dsh-plugin-kit` failed `ENEEDAUTH` because npm's trusted-publisher binding named the workflow file that *used* to perform the OIDC exchange; `@perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider` never reached npm at all because its pre-publish `verify` gate failed and the publish job was `skipped`; and nine repos mirror the version in `src/version.ts` (one in a `VERSION` file) behind tests that fail on drift. The new check answers the four questions that cover all five shapes — LOCKSTEP (does every carrier agree with `package.json`), PUBLISHED, PROVENANCE (which workflow file published it, read from the version's own attestation bundle), and FILES (does the published tarball still carry `src/`, `lib/` or `dist/`) — and exits non-zero on any of them, so a silent drift cannot sit unnoticed until the next release.
- **A `--roster` mode** that verifies the published artifact of every declared family member without checking any of them out: `data/verified-repos.json` is the same authoritative roster the monthly K14 gate uses, so "which packages" has exactly one source and a new member is picked up automatically. It reads provenance directly (the SLSA predicate names the repository and workflow path), which is what makes a stale trusted-publisher binding detectable from outside npm.

### Notes

- `--no-registry` runs only the LOCKSTEP pass. That is the mode per-repo CI should use: a downstream repository must never go red because the registry is slow. This repository's own workflow is the one place that probes the registry, because "what users actually install" is the thing being verified.
- Two carrier shapes are asserted FAMILY-WIDE and therefore fail the check: `src/version.ts`'s exported `VERSION`, and a `VERSION` file. `SKILL.md` frontmatter is deliberately only a NOTE — most skills carry their own independent version (`0.1.0` in `dsh-fund-research` and `dsh-industry-research`, whose suites do not assert it), while `dsh-skill-pack-security` asserts all sixteen of its own. Reporting skill versions as failures would have produced two false positives on the first run.
- Tarball layouts differ across the family: `src/` for most, `lib/` for built bundles, and `dist/` for `dsh-plugin-guide` and `dsh-wechat`. All three are accepted; asserting only `src`/`lib` was a false positive on those two.
## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **A monthly cross-repo (K14) gate, `scripts/check-cross-repo.mjs` + `.github/workflows/cross-repo.yml`.** K14 compares this plugin's injection points (service keys, tool names, command names, patch `insert` ids) against its sibling repositories inside a family workspace, and it is the only check that can catch "two plugins register the same service key" before it reaches a user's profile. In a per-repo CI there are no siblings, so K14 degrades to `skip` **on purpose** — a downstream repository must never go red for a check it structurally cannot run. The cost of that decision was that nobody ran K14 unless a human did it by hand; this closes that gap for this repository without asking any other repo to check out 40 siblings. Instead of cloning the family it materialises a throwaway workspace from the **published tarballs**: `data/verified-repos.json` is the authoritative roster (so a new member is picked up automatically and "who is in the family" keeps exactly one source), and a published tarball ships the only two inputs K14 reads — `package.json`, including the `dshPluginDoctor.crossPlugin` exemption declaration, and `src/`. That means the gate tests what users actually install rather than a collection of working trees. Extraction is done with `node:zlib` rather than the `tar` binary, because this host's Git ships GNU tar which shadows System32 bsdtar and does not accept `--one-top-level`. The job fails on `fail`, on an unexempted `warn`, and on `skip`/`missing`: a stage that silently failed to build must never read as "no collisions found".

### Fixed

- **K1 no longer reports a locally-declared `ctx` object as an undeclared service access.** K1 flags `ctx.<name>` reads that no `inject` covers. It already skipped files whose `ctx` is a *type* parameter; it now also skips files that declare their own `ctx` variable (`const ctx = { … }`), which is an ordinary local context bag rather than a cordis `Context`. Measured on this repository's own `doctor.mjs`, whose `const ctx = { sandboxRoots, coverage, … }` made K1 report `ctx.sandboxRoots` and `ctx.coverage` as missing from `inject` — a pure false positive that appeared in this repository's own gate on every run. The check still fires on a genuine violation (verified with a probe repository that reads `ctx.someUndeclaredService`), so the change narrows the check rather than silencing it.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- **Group K gains a cross-plugin interference tier, K10–K13.** The first nine K checks answer *"is this plugin correct on its own?"*; these four answer *"does it interfere with other plugins, or can another plugin silently eat it?"*. They stay inside the existing `K` group, so `--only K` and every downstream `plugin-doctor.yml` keep their meaning; the checkset string moves to `R0-R8+K1-K14+D0-D3,D9+CC1-CC5/3`.
  - **K10 — waterfall listeners must delegate `next()`.** A listener registered on a `waterfall` event that never calls `next()` silently swallows every downstream listener on that chain, including the built-in behaviour. `agent/pre-step` alone has 15 official consumers, so the blast radius is ecosystem-wide. The check deliberately only condemns *inline* listener bodies whose whole file never mentions `next`: a listener passed by reference (`ctx.on('approval/request', bridge.onApproval)`) delegates elsewhere and is not judged. That restraint is measured, not assumed — the first draft flagged `dsh-reach`, whose listeners do delegate, and the tightened rule reports zero warnings across a 20-plugin sample while still firing on a planted defect.
  - **K11 — tool names that shadow built-in or reserved names.** Two same-named registrations in one layer throw, and the explicit `tools.data.delete(def.name)` + re-register idiom instead *rewrites* the tool the model sees. That two-step idiom is how a widely installed third-party plugin redefines the built-in `get_goal` / `create_goal` / `update_goal`, so the check looks for both the collision and the idiom.
  - **K12 — a provided service key equal to a host seam.** Cordis permits exactly one provider per service key per isolate scope, so a second provider cannot take effect; replacing a host seam requires the original row to be explicitly disabled rather than run alongside.
  - **K13 — a patch that overrides a built-in row's `config`.** An id-targeted patch replaces the target row's **whole** `config` object instead of deep-merging, so two bundles overriding the same built-in row silently erase each other and the winner is decided only by `dsh.profile.bundles` order. An override row also asserts `name`, and a mismatch skips the whole patch.
  - All four return `skip` when no source files were discovered, preserving the whole-group degradation contract that the `bare → exit 6` selftest guards.
  - Reference data (the 17 `waterfall` events, 65 built-in tool names, host-owned patch row ids) is extracted from upstream machine-readable sources at baseline DSH `0.2.0-rc.2` — the `@mode` column of `docs/event-producer-consumer.md`, the `### \`name\`` sections of `docs/tool-catalog.md`, and the top-level ids of `packages/bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml`.

- **Group K gains a cross-repo tier, K14 — "injection-point name collision across sibling repos".** K10–K13 judge one repository in isolation and so cannot see the collisions that cost the most in practice: a Cordis service key admits exactly one provider per isolate scope, and a second registration of the same tool name in one layer throws. K14 walks the family workspace given by `--workspace`, keeps every sibling `dsh-*` repo that really is a DSH plugin (a `dsh` manifest field, or a `@deepseek-ai/dsh*` peer), extracts each side's owned names — service keys from `super(ctx, …)` / `ctx.provide(…)`, tool names from `defineTool({ name })`, command names from `ctx.commands.register({ name })`, and patch `insert` row ids — and reports the intersections.
  - **Guard-aware exemptions, so a deliberate design is not reported as a defect.** A plugin that keeps a *runtime* first-provider-wins stand-down guard still contains the contested name in its source, so a source-only comparison cannot tell it apart from a genuine collision. The author declares intent rather than the tool guessing:
    ```json
    "dsh-plugin-doctor": {
      "crossPlugin": { "exempt": [
        { "kind": "service", "name": "roomHub", "peer": "dsh-team-rooms", "guard": "0.9.14" }
      ] }
    }
    ```
    `guard` records the version in which the stand-down landed, so an exemption cannot silently outlive the code that justified it. A zero-dependency `dsh-plugin-doctor.yml` sidecar accepts the same list. `dsh-background-agents` uses it for its room half (nine names against `dsh-team-rooms`).
  - **Never a silent pass.** With no source files, or a workspace holding fewer than two plugin repos, K14 returns `skip` — consistent with the whole-group degradation contract (`degradedGroups` requires the entire K group to be unrunnable), which the `bare → exit 6` selftest guards. CI is unaffected: the shipped workflow passes no `--workspace`, so K14 degrades to `skip` there and can never fail a downstream build.
  - `tests/selftest.mjs` now covers all three K14 paths: a genuine sibling collision warns, the same collision declared as an exemption passes, and a workspace without a second plugin repo skips.
- `tests/contract.mjs`'s gated-count assertion moves 16 → 21 to account for the five new checks (K10–K14).

### Changed

- The shipped workflow template pins `@perrylink/dsh-plugin-doctor@0.5.0`, in both `plugin-doctor.yml` and its `.github/workflows/` copy — which a contract test requires to stay byte-identical.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Host pins move to `0.2.1-alpha.1`; re-verified against that host line.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **`action.yml`'s `description` was 151 characters; GitHub Marketplace requires under 125.** Marketplace validates the metadata when you tick "Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace" on a release, and an over-long description is one of the things it rejects — so the listing could not be created as the file stood. It is now 100 characters, leaving margin, and still says what the action is: *"Static verification gate for DSH plugins - package structure and cordis contract, zero dependencies."*
  - Only the top-level `description` is affected. `inputs[].description` and `outputs[].description` have no such limit and are unchanged.
  - This needed a release of its own, because the Marketplace reads `action.yml` **at the tag being published**, not from the branch. Editing the file on `main` without a new tag would have left the checkbox validating the old metadata.

### Notes

- The other Marketplace requirements were already satisfied, and were checked rather than assumed: the repository is public; `action.yml` sits at the repository root; `author` is set; `branding` carries both an icon (`shield`) and a colour (`blue`); and the name `dsh-plugin-doctor` collides with no existing Marketplace action name, GitHub user or organisation, or Marketplace category.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-09-24

> Version note: the work below was prepared as `0.4.3`, and that version was **never
> published**. The `0.4.3` commit carried a `package.json` that did not parse, so the
> repair and this work shipped together as `0.4.4`. The tag and the package version now
> agree, which is what the release workflow's own guard checks.

### Fixed

- **`package.json` did not parse**, and the commit that broke it also shipped. Bumping the version through a PowerShell round trip (`Get-Content -Raw | Set-Content -Encoding utf8`) turned the CJK keywords into mojibake and dropped a character to a bare `?`, which is invalid JSON. The file is restored from the last good commit and edited with a UTF-8-preserving writer.
- **Six scratch scripts were committed into the release.** `git add -A` in a repository whose tooling writes scratch files into the root swept them in with the release. Removed, and the release used an explicit path list instead.
- **The CJK keywords had already been wrong since `7e6718f`** and were never verified. Checked by code point — `93BB 638D 6B22` rather than `63D2 4EF6` — and rebuilt from code points. Verified on the published artefact by fetching the registry document **as raw bytes**: the correct UTF-8 sequence appears three times and the double-encoded form zero times.
  - A note on that verification, because it nearly produced a false alarm: `Invoke-RestMethod` decoded the registry response as latin-1 and made correct UTF-8 look like mojibake. **The registry was never wrong; the reader was.** Byte-level checks are the only ones that settle an encoding question.

### Added

- **`R8` now detects open-top peer ranges** — a `>=` comparator with no upper bound. `>=0.1.0-rc.1` admits `0.5.0`, `1.0.0` and anything later, so a breaking host line is accepted by the range and the plugin loads against an API it never tested. That failure is silent, which is why it is worth naming.

  `^0.1.0-rc.1` does **not** have this problem: caret is semver sugar for `>=0.1.0-rc.1 <0.2.0`, so it is bounded even though the string contains no `<`. Measured across 22 third-party DSH repositories on 2026-09-24, the caret form is the prevailing convention — so the check separates a real defect from the ecosystem's normal practice instead of flagging every range without a literal `<`.

  Found by running the tool against those 22 repositories: `LuckVd/dsh-taskflow` has six open-top ranges, four of which name `0.0.1-rc.1` and were therefore **invisible to every earlier version** of this check.

- **`category: policy`** joins the vocabulary in `SPEC.md` §3.3. `warn` otherwise defaulted to `plugin-defect`, which contradicted `R8`'s own first line — a message reading "this is a policy staleness, not a plugin defect" filed under `plugin-defect` is a report that disagrees with itself. `R8` now reports `policy` for both its `fail` and its `warn`, matching §5.4 note 4, which already said `R5` and `R8` encode policy rather than correctness.

### Fixed

- **An `R8` failure no longer swallows its notes.** `>=0.1.0-rc.1` is both stale and open-top, and the failure branch returned early — so a repository would have seen only the cosmetic staleness and kept the range that admits a breaking host line. Both now appear, under an explicit "also, unrelated to staleness" heading.

### Verified

- The refined `R8` was run against **61 repositories** — the 43-repository family fleet plus the 22-repository third-party sample — before release. **No repository changed status except by gaining the new warning**, and the four third-party failures that exist are the same four as before the change. `dsh-ticktick` is the only family repository that warns, which is the intended outcome of the 0.3.2 refinement.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **`action.yml` — the gate is now a composite GitHub Action**, so a repository can adopt it with one step instead of copying a workflow file:

  ```yaml
  - uses: PerryLink/dsh-plugin-doctor@v0.4.0
    with:
      only: R,K
  ```

  Inputs: `report-dir`, `only`, `smoke`, `dsh`, `format`. Outputs: `verdict`, `exit-code`, `summary`, `failing`, `report-path`. No install step is needed — the tool has no runtime dependencies. Branding is set (`shield`, blue) for a Marketplace listing.

  The entry point resolves the tool through `GITHUB_ACTION_PATH`, not a relative path, because a composite action runs in the **caller's** workspace. That is the same class of mistake as a repository declaring a `bin` of the same name: the invocation, not the tool, decides which code runs.

### Fixed

- **The Action's `verdict` output emitted `[object Object]`.** `report.verdict` is an object (`{worst, ok, criticalFail}`), not a string, so a consumer would have stored a literal `[object Object]` as though it were a verdict. It now emits the readable `worst` value.
- **The summary assumed the `doctor` report shape**, so `--format check` — the ecosystem three-value contract — reported `gated=0`. Both shapes are now read: `.results` (lowercase status) and `.checks` (uppercase), normalised to one summary that names the format it read.

### Notes

- `action.yml` and `.github/actions/` are included in the published tarball, so the Action works from the npm package as well as from a git ref. Verified with `npm pack`: 23 files.
- **`verdict` is the *worst* status across the gated checks**, so a run with no failures reports `skip` rather than `pass` when any check was skipped. That is the tool's long-standing exit-code contract, now stated here because an Action output makes it visible to consumers who never read the exit code.

> **The Action's outputs were broken in the 0.4.0 release, and 0.4.0 is what npm serves.**
> `v0.4.1` and `v0.4.2` exist as git tags but were **never published to npm**: each was
> cut to test the fix and each was blocked by the smoke test until the output mapping
> was right. They are not listed as releases because they did not ship.
>
> The defect: a composite action's outputs must be mapped **explicitly** with
> `value: ${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<name> }}`. Declaring the names alone is not enough —
> the runner records `"outputs": {}` and every `steps.<id>.outputs.*` reference
> resolves to the empty string. The action ran correctly, printed its summary and
> wrote `GITHUB_OUTPUT` successfully; consumers still received nothing.
>
> It was found only by invoking the released Action from a real workflow. The local
> harness sets `GITHUB_OUTPUT` and reads the file back, so it reported five correct
> outputs while the runner reported none — a reminder that a test which supplies the
> environment it is testing cannot detect a missing environment.
>
> **Consumers should use `@v0.4.2` or later.** `@v0.4.0` runs and gates correctly, but
> its outputs are empty.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **`R8` turned a deliberate host choice into a red CI run.** The check flagged any single-arm prerelease-tuple range, on the correct reasoning that `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0` without `||` silently rejects `0.1.5-rc.1`. But it could not distinguish that trap from a range naming a *current* line, and the second case is a choice about which host to support rather than a defect. The consequence was measured, not theorised: `dsh-ticktick`, whose peers are `>=0.1.7-alpha.1 <0.2.0`, **passed R8 on 0.1.6 and failed it on 0.3.1** — over a rule added after its ranges were written — so raising the family pin would have turned its gate red.
  - A range naming a **superseded** line (`0.1.0-rc.*`, `0.1.1-rc.*`, `0.1.2-alpha.*`, `0.1.3-alpha.*`) still **fails**. That is the trap the OR form exists to fix.
  - A **single-arm** range now reports `warn`, naming the real consequence — it excludes whatever line is `latest`, so the plugin will not install against the stable host — without condemning the package. `warn` does not fail a gate, so `dsh-ticktick` exits 0 again.
  - `SPEC.md` §4.1/R8 records the distinction, and `tests/contract.mjs` pins both directions: a superseded line must still fail, and a current-line arm must warn without producing a gated failure.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-23

Published via **npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** — no token involved. The
`NPM_TOKEN` secret had expired, which had blocked this work for several rounds,
so the release path was switched to a credential that cannot expire. See the
token rotation checklist, section 7.

### Fixed

- **`GOVERNANCE.md` and `CITATION.cff` were missing from the npm tarball.** Both
  were added to the repository in 0.3.0 but never added to `package.json`'s
  `files` list, so neither reached any adopter — and `CITATION.cff` is pointless
  unless it ships with the artifact it describes, because its whole purpose is to
  produce a correct author line for anyone citing the tool. Found by packing the
  published 0.3.0 tarball and listing it, not by reading the manifest.
- **A successful publish reported as a red run.** `softprops/action-gh-release`
  needs a tag, and on a `workflow_dispatch` run the ref is a branch, so the step
  failed after npm had already published — and no GitHub Release was created. The
  workflow now derives the tag from `package.json` and passes it explicitly, so
  the step works on both the tag-push and manual-dispatch paths.

### Added

- **`workflow_dispatch` on the publish workflow**, so a release can be retried
  after a credential fix without inventing a version. The tag-matches-version
  check is skipped for non-tag refs, where it is meaningless.

### Changed

- **The third-party scan is refreshed, and the refresh is re-runnable.** `THIRD-PARTY-RK-SCAN.md` was a 2026-09-10 snapshot from 0.2.0. A published result set that keeps asserting superseded verdicts is the documentation-that-lies failure this project exists to catch, so `scripts/refresh-third-party-scan.ps1` re-clones each candidate read-only, re-applies the qualification gate, re-runs the gate, and records the verdict — never installing, building or booting third-party code. Result: **19 qualified, 6 pass, 13 fail** (was 10/10). Comparing repository by repository, the `R3`/`R7` corrections changed **no** repository's verdict; the movement is entirely `R8`, which went from 3 to 9 without a line of code changing, because the ecosystem's peer lines moved on. That is an argument for re-running this on a schedule rather than treating a snapshot as standing fact.
- **`R8` now says what it means.** A peer pinned to a superseded release-candidate line is a package that *works* and has fallen behind this family's release train — staleness, not breakage. The verdict stays `fail` (the exit code is a frozen contract 42 downstream gates read) but the message now states the narrower meaning first, and `SPEC.md` §5.4 makes that scope limit normative. Without it, a third-party maintainer reading the output would reasonably conclude their plugin is broken.
- **Gate coverage 38 → 42 repositories.** `dsh-wechat`, `dsh-personal-directive`, `dsh-cert-mcp` and `dsh-plugin-kit` now ship `.github/workflows/plugin-doctor.yml`. Each was dry-run first and passes its own gate (exit 0, 16 gated checks, `R0 `/`K1 ` self-check green). `dsh-plugin-upgrade-016` is gate-eligible but was left alone: it sits on an active `ci/bootstrap-ops` branch. A regression sweep over 49 family repositories confirmed the R3/R7 changes turned **no** previously-passing repository red.
- **`R3` and `R7` stopped rejecting valid packages** (landed in the 0.3.0 build but first shipped to npm here — see the 0.3.0 entry for the detail).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-23

This is the release that actually ships the specification and the attribution.
Through 0.2.3 the published tarball contained neither `SPEC.md` nor `NOTICE` nor
the gate template, so `npx @perrylink/dsh-plugin-doctor` gave every adopter a
build in which the criteria had no author and no normative text.

It is a **minor** bump rather than 0.2.4 because it adds a CLI surface
(`--format`) and because `v0.2.4` was already tagged and published to the
repository while pointing at a commit that predates these documentation fixes —
moving a pushed tag would have been worse than bumping. `0.2.4` was never
released to npm; see its entry below for the failure record.

Everything in the 0.2.4 entry below is included here, plus the `--format check`
contract view and the documentation corrections.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-23 — repository tag only, never published to npm

This release is the one that finally **ships the specification and the
attribution**: through 0.2.3 the published tarball contained neither `SPEC.md`
nor `NOTICE` nor the gate template, so `npx @perrylink/dsh-plugin-doctor` gave
every adopter a build in which the criteria had no author and no normative text.

> **Not on npm.** The `v0.2.4` tag was pushed and the `publish` workflow ran,
> but the npm publish step failed with `npm error 404 Not Found - PUT
> https://registry.npmjs.org/@perrylink%2fdsh-plugin-doctor`. The `NPM_TOKEN`
> secret is present but not usable (invalid, expired, or lacking this package), so
> `latest` on npm is still **0.2.3**. The workflow correctly refused to report
> success. Its contents are superseded by **0.3.0**.

### Added

- **`--format check` — a view that speaks the ecosystem's plugin-check contract.** Three independent DSH checkers (this one, `zoahdev/dsh-plugin-doctor`, `boyin111-1/dsh-doctor`, `moonquake2004/dsh-doctor`) converged during 2026-08 on a three-value status vocabulary (`PASS`/`WARN`/`FAIL`), exit codes `0`/`1`/`2`, and a flat `checks` array — written up as [RFC #1846](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/1846). This project's envelope is deliberately richer (five statuses, seven exit codes, per-check ids and coverage), so no interoperating tool could read it. `--format check` restates the same run in the contract's vocabulary without changing it: the two views must agree on pass/fail, a `skip` is never rendered as `PASS` (it becomes `WARN` plus `skipped: true`), and anything the contract cannot express is carried in a `doctor` side field or flagged `approximated`. `SPEC.md` §1.1 makes these three properties normative. The default view is untouched, so the 38 downstream gates are unaffected. `tests/compat.mjs` asserts 25 of these properties, including that `--format check` and the default view never disagree.
- **`SPEC.md` — the criteria now exist as a versioned, citable specification.** Until now the 28 checks were defined only by the Chinese label string passed to `doctor.add()` in `lib/*.mjs`, with the ID derived from that display string by regex; a third party could not write "conforms to dsh-plugin-doctor SPEC v1 §K3" and have it resolve to anything, and `README.md`'s catalog was a five-row group table. `SPEC.md` gives every check a stable ID, its normative requirement, its verdict vocabulary, what a failure means, its scope limits, and change control — so a result can be cited and stay meaningful. Authored by PerryLink, who is named as such.
- **`NOTICE` + `CITATION.cff` + `GOVERNANCE.md` — attribution that travels with the artifact.** Apache-2.0 §4(d) requires a redistributor to preserve a `NOTICE` file; with no `NOTICE` present there was nothing to preserve, so attribution could not survive a fork. `GOVERNANCE.md` records who authored the criteria, how spec versions change, and separates what is *asked* (keep the criteria attributed to PerryLink) from what is *required* (the licence term).
- **`plugin-doctor.yml` at the repository root — the gate is shipped, not scraped.** The canonical workflow lived only in `reports/`, which `.gitignore` excludes and `package.json` `files[]` omitted, so every adopter had to reconstruct the 15-line step from a README code block. It is now a tracked, published file inside the npm tarball.
- **A self-serve badge path (README "Path A").** The existing badge is a centralized, single-operator service: an adopter must open a PR, the author must merge, and the author's CI must render the SVG with a PAT. That is a single point of failure, and it has failed — `data/verified.json` currently holds 37/37 `no-data` entries reading `repo lookup failed: 401 Unauthorized`, so every issued badge renders grey. Path A uses shields.io against the adopter's own workflow and needs no registry entry, no PR, and no token from anyone.
- `author` and `contributors` in `package.json` (both were absent, so the npm page named no author).
- **A guard that keeps `SPEC.md` from drifting away from the code.** A specification is a second source of truth, and one that disagrees with the implementation is worse than no specification: a third party citing `SPEC v1 §K3` must get what the code actually does. `tests/spec-drift.mjs` parses `SPEC.md` and asserts, against a real run, that §4 declares exactly the registered check IDs (28, both directions), that the §1 gate set matches the actually-gated set item by item, and that §2's single `critical` claim is the only one flagged in code. `tests/spec-drift-meta.mjs` then tests the guard itself — including that a declaration missing `K9` does *not* compare equal — so it cannot pass vacuously.

### Fixed

- **R2/R4 blamed the plugin for an unbuilt tree.** Both checks read *built*
  artifacts, and on a source tree that ships no build output — most third-party
  repositories, and every clone that has not been built — the entry is absent by
  construction. They reported that as `plugin-defect`, which is the tool telling
  a maintainer their plugin is broken when they had simply not run
  `npm run build`. A sweep of 15 family repositories found 4 mislabelled this
  way. Both now report `skip` with category `environment` when the entry resolves
  into a build-output directory, is absent, and is *correctly* covered by `files`.
  The condition is deliberately narrow: if `main` points into `src/`, or the
  build output is missing from `files`, the check still **fails**, because those
  defects survive a build. `tests/contract.mjs` now pins both directions (an
  unbuilt tree is not a defect; a real `files` defect is still a defect).
- **Two self-test sandboxes violated the host's protected temp namespace.**
  `tests/selftest.mjs` created `%TEMP%\dsh-doctor-selftest-*` and
  `%TEMP%\dsh-doctor-dash-*`. The host reserves the `%TEMP%\dsh-*` template, and
  the tool's own comment in `lib/util.mjs` records that the `doctor-` prefix was
  chosen precisely to avoid it — but the tests did not follow it, leaking two
  directories per run and never cleaning them up. Caught by the existing
  "no new `%TEMP%\dsh-doctor-*` directories" assertion. Both now use the
  `doctor-` prefix.
- **The Path B audit failed as one opaque line, 37 times.** With no usable `DOCTOR_AUDIT_TOKEN` the script fell back to the workflow-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which holds no cross-repository read permission and is therefore treated as an anonymous caller (60 requests/hour) — a full audit needs 200+. Every entry came back `no-data` with the identical `403 rate limit exceeded`, and an earlier run reported `401 Unauthorized`; both are configuration faults that read as a broken badge program. `scripts/verify.mjs` now stops at the first `401`/rate-limited `403`, exits `3`, and writes an all-grey registry whose reasons name the actual cause. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback is gone: it could never have worked. `--allow-anonymous` (or `DOCTOR_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=1`) keeps the local, partial-audit convenience but warns first.
- **`LICENSE` credited the wrong project.** The appendix copyright line read `Copyright 2026 dsh-memento contributors` — a different PerryLink plugin, inherited when the file was copied from a sibling repository. The Apache-2.0 text itself carries no other copyright line, so the only copyright statement in the licence named a project that is not this one. It now reads `Copyright 2026 PerryLink`. The same wrong line was present in 15 sibling repositories and has been corrected there too, each a verified one-line diff.

### Changed

- `README` version drift corrected: the body said "Current version 0.2.0" and pinned the gate example to `0.1.6` while `package.json` and npm were both `0.2.3`. New adopters are now told to pin the current version; the family's existing `0.1.6` pin is left untouched and explained.
- The README's inline gate YAML was replaced by a pointer to the shipped `plugin-doctor.yml`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Add the missing `dsh-plugin` keyword. This was the only published `@perrylink/*` package without it, so `keywords:dsh-plugin` on the npm registry (41 of 42 packages matched) and the topic-driven directories that key off the same convention could not reach it by that route.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Widen the stale-peer-range detector beyond the single `>=0.1.0-rc.N <0.2.0` shape it was written for, and stop claiming the `--dsh` default is "npm 已发布 latest" (npm `@deepseek-ai/dsh` latest is `0.1.5-rc.1`). The default itself is unchanged: 38 downstream CI gates rely on it as a peer-floor smoke.

## 0.2.0

- **Silent-pass fixes (the load-bearing change)** — three ways this tool could return a green result without having actually decided anything are now closed:
  - The K group's source-file discovery required `!pkg.scripts.build` before falling back to `lib/**`. Published packages keep their `scripts`, so an installed-package directory or an unpacked tarball produced **zero files inspected → K1–K9 all skipped → exit 0**. The fallback no longer checks for a build script, and `main` is now `./`-stripped (family repos with `main: "./index.mjs"` never triggered the old fallback).
  - `R5` returned `pass` when there was no `src/` to scan ("a pure-JS repo may have no cordis runtime dependency"). It now returns `skip` — and it is one of the 16 gated checks.
  - A requested group whose checks all skipped is reported as **degraded** and exits **6** (use `--allow-degraded` to accept it explicitly). Previously only "zero checks executed" was caught.
- **New exit codes**: `3` infrastructure, `4` unsupported host (a host install failure is no longer reported as a plugin defect), `5` unstable, `6` degraded. `0/1/2` are unchanged, and the family gate never reads the exit code, so nothing downstream changes.
- **New options**: `--workspace/-w`, `--allow-degraded`, `--json -`, `--purge`, `-v/--version`. **Unknown options are now a usage error (exit 2)** — previously an unrecognised long option had its value assigned to `--repo`, silently retargeting the check.
- **JSON envelope v2** (`schemaVersion: "2"`): adds `doctorVersion`, `checksetVersion`, `target`, `env`, `coverage`, `groups`, `degraded`, `verdict`, `quarantine`, and per-result `id`/`groupId`/`category`. **`name` keeps its `R0 `/`K1 ` prefix — that prefix is a frozen contract** (the family workflow greps for `R0 ` and `K1 ` on the rendered output and splits `results[].name` on `/^R[24] /`).
- **Sandbox discipline**: `dsh plugin add` now passes `--ignore-scripts` (the target's install/prepare scripts never run on the host); pnpm's ignored-builds block is classified `environment` instead of being counted as a plugin result; `npm pack` writes into the sandbox (8 family repos had accumulated 17 stray `.tgz` files); the sandbox prefix is now `doctor-` so it no longer collides with the host's protected `%TEMP%\dsh-*` template; the sandbox is **quarantined, never deleted** (three-stage delete discipline) with `--purge` as the explicit third stage.
- **Report hygiene**: run-time absolute paths are replaced with `<path>` in both the JSON and the rendered text, so a report can be committed into someone else's repository without tripping their path-leak gate.
- **CC group semantics**: `CC5`'s three gates (Apache-2.0 / five-language READMEs / seam markers) are PerryLink-family standards, not ecosystem standards. Outside a family workspace it now reports `not-applicable` instead of failing any third-party repository (and instead of letting the whole CC group look like an environment failure).
- **Regression proof**: a 37-repo before/after baseline over the whole family (`--only R,K --no-smoke`) shows **zero item-level changes**; `tests/contract.mjs` freezes the five observables the family CI depends on; `tests/selftest.mjs` grows from 7 to 14 cases with the original 7 unchanged.
- **Release-path hardening (this repository's own CI)** — the same silent-pass class, closed one level up: `ci.yml` now runs `tests/contract.mjs` on every push instead of only inside the publish workflow, where a break would already have been shipped; and `publish.yml` no longer exits `0` when `NPM_TOKEN` is absent — a release that published nothing used to look green. A post-publish step now asserts the version is actually visible on the registry before the GitHub Release is created. (This supersedes the "skips cleanly when `NPM_TOKEN` is absent" wording in 0.1.5.)
- **Public result set**: `THIRD-PARTY-RK-SCAN.md` + `data/rk-scans.json` — the first static R+K scan of **third-party** (non-PerryLink) DSH plugins: 60 candidates → 20 that actually declare `dsh.bundle.patch` → **10 passing / 10 failing** under the 16 gated checks, with the method, this scan's own methodology error, and a corrections path for named maintainers. No third-party code was executed.

## 0.1.7

- **Gate form migration (family CI)**: the 36 plugin repos' `plugin-doctor.yml` no longer carries the `\u`-escaped `DOCTOR_ONLY` environment variable; the gate now runs `npx --yes @perrylink/dsh-plugin-doctor@0.1.6 --repo . --no-smoke --only "R,K"` directly, so the whole step is plain ASCII and self-explanatory. The R0/K1 self-check and the JSON gate (R2/R4 reported but gated by each repo's `ci.yml`) are unchanged. Rolled out canary-first (`gated 16 checks; build-dependent: R2=pass R4=pass`), then all 36 repos: 36/36 green, registry `gate=ascii-alias + self-check`, `doctorPinned=0.1.6`.
- **Registry discipline**: `scripts/verify.mjs` now labels the detected gate form (`ascii-alias` / `ascii-escaped` / `chinese-names`, each optionally `+ self-check`) instead of collapsing both ASCII forms into one label, and it fails the workflow loudly when *every* declared repo comes back `no-data` (expired `DOCTOR_AUDIT_TOKEN` or exhausted rate limit) while still committing the honest grey registry.
- **Docs**: README gate snippet, "状态" line and the family repo count now match the shipped gate. Published so the npm page matches the repository; the installed CLI surface is identical to 0.1.6.

## 0.1.6

- **Docs/design sync (no CLI behavior change)**: the README's verified-badge section now documents the final shipped badge design (monospace UPPERCASE + letter-spacing + shield-check mark + 5px corners; platinum/silver left panel with deep-navy label text; one solid GitHub-conventional state block on the right) and describes the family gate as reading the committed tree (no install/build; R2/R4 gated by each repo's own `ci.yml`). The "状态" section and CI snippet now pin 0.1.6. Published so the npm page matches the repository; `scripts/` and `badges/` are not in the npm `files` list, so the installed CLI surface is identical to 0.1.5.

## 0.1.5

- **Group aliases (encoding-safe)**: `--only` now accepts the ASCII aliases `R`, `K`, `D`, `CC` (case-insensitive) in addition to the Chinese group names. Chinese group names had silently rotted into double-encoded mojibake in 35 repos' `plugin-doctor.yml`, which made `--only` match nothing.
- **Refuse to pass silently**: an `--only` value that matches no registered group, or a run in which zero checks execute, now exits **2** with the available groups instead of the previous "0 checks, exit 0" false green. This is the root-cause guard for the mojibake class of bug.
- **`tests/selftest.mjs`**: seven real CLI cases (good fixture, alias case-insensitivity, single group, Chinese full name, unknown group, mojibake group, broken fixture) run in a `%TEMP%` sandbox; wired into `npm test`, `ci.yml` and `publish.yml`.
- **Verified badge program**: `data/verified-repos.json` (declared repos), `scripts/verify.mjs` (audits each repo's own `plugin-doctor` CI gate through the GitHub API — no cloning, no installing, no executing third-party code), `scripts/badge.mjs` (SVG renderer), `data/verified.json` (registry, generated by CI), `badges/<owner>__<repo>.svg`, and `.github/workflows/verified.yml` (daily + on push). Badge meaning: `dsh-doctor passing|warning|failing|no data` — the repo's own static R+K gate is green on the current default-branch HEAD. The gate covers 16 checks (R0/R1/R3/R5/R6/R7/R8 + K1–K9) on the committed tree; R2/R4 read built artifacts and are gated by each repo's own `ci.yml`. Not a certification badge: no Scorecard, provenance or install smoke.
- **Badge visual design (2026-09-09)**: modern grammar borrowed from the ecosystem's newer badges (dsh.directory: monospace UPPERCASE + letter-spacing + mark + gradient; awesome-dsh-plugin: seal block) — platinum/silver left panel with a shield-check mark and deep-navy monospace label (五行 金行主导 = 白/银/铂金, 水行 = 墨蓝), one solid GitHub-conventional state block on the right (green/amber/red/grey) with the state word plus a path-drawn glyph (check / exclamation / cross / dash), 5px corners, 1px border. Chosen by vision-model review of rendered candidates: gold as a pass color reads as a warning, a borderless platinum panel vanishes on white, and a thin state bar or tiny dot is unreadable at 20px — the solid state block won. Per-state gradient ids keep several badges safe to inline in one document.
- **Gate hardening after the 2026-09-09 sweep**: the family `plugin-doctor.yml` no longer runs install/build. A naive `npm run build` fails without the pinned harness aliases (`HARNESS_COMMIT` + `gen-aliases`) and its prebuild wiped the committed `lib/`, which produced 17 false-red gates. The gate now reads the committed tree only and reports R2/R4 without gating on them.
- **Repo infrastructure**: `ci.yml` (node 22/24: syntax check, self-test, `npm pack --dry-run`), `scorecard.yml` (OpenSSF Scorecard with `publish_results`), `publish.yml` (tag-triggered npm publish with provenance; skips cleanly when `NPM_TOKEN` is absent), README badge row.

## 0.1.4

- K1 no longer flags local type-parameter `ctx` declarations; K3 detects variable-level cleanup and checks the preceding line (three false positives removed; `dsh-github` K group is 9/9 PASS).

## 0.1.3

- R3 strips YAML comment lines before the heuristic scan; R5 treats a pure-JS repo with no cordis dependency as passing.

## 0.1.2

- `verdict.ok` follows the documented exit-code contract: `warn`/`skip` do not fail the run.

## 0.1.1

- Fix duplicated shebang in the entry file (ESM SyntaxError on first publish).

## 0.1.0

- First release: four layers — static package structure (R0–R8), cordis contract scan (K1–K9), keyless-headless sandbox smoke (D0–D3, D9), ecosystem listing checks (CC1–CC5). Zero dependencies, Node ≥22 built-ins only.
